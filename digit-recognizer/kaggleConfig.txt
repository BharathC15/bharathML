pip install kaggle


Go to the kaggle website.

Click on Your profile button on the top right and then select My Account.

Scroll down to the API section and click on the Create New API Token button.

It will initiate the download of a file call kaggle.json. Save the file at a known location on your machine.


Move the downloaded file to a location ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json. If you donâ€™t have the .kaggle folder in your home directory, you can create one using the command:
mkdir ~/.kaggle

Now move the downloaded file to this location using:
mv <location>/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

You need to give proper permissions to the file (since this is a hidden folder):
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json


Run the command 'kaggle competitions list'.
